                    For this final project in creative coding, I decided to challenge myself in creating something that looked interesting to me. I was influenced by the progress and knowledge I acquired from the first project for this class which emphasized math and language. In that project I used pixel information using the img.get function to grab information which I could sort and manipulate the overall image by changing the space and shape between pixels. I decided to expand upon this concept by creating a map of ‘tiles’ that used a specified length and width of information that grabbed information from an image and replaced these tiles within parameters that I set including tile-length, tile-width, border, tile-offset, and tile-rotation. I used the random() function along the way to create visually interesting content with every iteration.

                    <br>
                    For this project I still needed to use pixel information from image files that already existed as jpg or png types. I wanted to create something visually intricate and I decided to refer to famous works of art that have been admired by many including in museums. While researching, I found multiple databases for museums that include high-quality downloadable images of artwork from sculptures, paintings and exhibits. I used images from museum databases including The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago with an emphasis on anatomy and natural themes of artwork. I knew that my method of random tile arraying would distort the appearance of some of these images however, I wanted to create a spectacle of visuals that held similarity to something that could be naturally observed. I wanted to see how the computer would randomize pixel information where an observer could still identify some small portions of what the original image could look like by drawing from previous memory of familiar human anatomical structures like muscles or scenes in nature such as waves in the water or flowers.

                    <br>
                    I liked how the final product turned out. I think it was a good decision to use the style of images that I used because it allowed for the creation of a sort of ‘mural’ while also maintaining elements of realism all coming together to create something simple but refreshing, interesting and identifiable.
